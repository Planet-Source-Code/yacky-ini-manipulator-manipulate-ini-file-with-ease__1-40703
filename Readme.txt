	This class manipulates INI file. Can Add, Edit & Delete Section, Keys and Key values.

	This code originated from Eric Daquist's clsINI which is also can be found on PSC.
I'm really thankful for sharing his code.  I have made some revisions and remove unnecessary
process and variables.  I'm not saying that my class now is much better than Eric.  All I can
I say is that I made it short and simple.

	If the INI file is not set, the INI file will be located at the windows directory having
this filename twwINImanipulator.ini.

	Feel free to use but I just hope you'll drop by a message if you have used it, I just want
to know if the class is useful or it's just a trash.  Thanks! Mabuhay!!!!!
